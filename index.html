                    If you've ever played Webkinz Classic, you probably know the joys of playing at the arcade and trying to get a high score. My absolute favorite is Operation Gumball. The game works similarly to the classic code-breaker game Mastermind. There are 30 levels, and you are awarded points based on number of guesses and time. It's a super fun game that I am, not to brag, pretty good at. I frequent the high score of the day slot and have even sat at high score of the month a few times. However, the <em>real</em> test of who's on top is the holy grail: the top ten overall scorers. I've come just shy of this list numerous times. I've even fantasized about sitting up at that number one spot. But something doesn't sit right with me... If you venture to the "Scores and Achievements" section of the Kinzville Times, you'll see that the top dog, a Webkinz named Sweet Pea, has a perfect score of 150,000. None of the other scores across any of the operation gumball pages are such a perfect number. The scoring is incredibly intricate and the numbers often seem nonsensical. Each level you are awarded a time bonus (hilariously misspelled as "tome bonus") relating to the number of seconds you have left, so you'd have to line them up perfectly over 30 levels to achieve such a round number. To illustrate this, I played the first 5 levels and recorded my scores in the table below.

                        <td>1269</td>
                        <td>62</td>
                        <td>4651</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>5</td>
                        <td>1404</td>
                        <td>73</td>
                        <td>6128</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    Below Sweet Pea, the second highest score is 148,325, and none of the next highest scores even crack 125,000. Is 150,000 simply the highest score possible? That might be the case, but if you ask me, there's a whole lot more to this story.

                    Yesterday, October 9th, I woke up just like any other day. Well, I slept a little too late but other than that it was okay. I ate some leftover tacos for breakfast and then I got started on some homework and studying. I was distracted and not super productive for most of the day (but what else is new?). Around 2 o'clock, I got ready to do my virtual interview. I wore a blue sweater. The interview was a 45 minute multiple choice test and then 5 questions that I had to record responses to. In case I actually did okay on the SEO on this website and they're looking me up and somehow seeing this, I will not share the name of the company or how I think the interview went. After the interview I went to my Eboard meeting for Phi Sigma Rho. It went pretty well, not very different from most. Then, I finished up my MI349 HTML 1 homework. Once I got home I decided to take a break and actually do something fun. So, I built the Lego succulent set. I haven't done a lego set since I was a little kid, and I had so much fun doing it. I ended up saving about a third of it to do another night. So yeah, pretty boring day, but probably not as boring as reading this blog post.
