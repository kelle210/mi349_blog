        <p style="clear: both; padding-top: 20px; font-size: 18px;">Alexa Kelley is a senior at Michigan State University studying computer science. In her free time, she likes to hang out with friends, snowboard, do the New York Times crossword, watch silly movies, and embroider. She is currently spending her time finishing up her education, job hunting, and learning a new sport - tennis!</p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Alexa grew up in Novi, Michigan with her Mom, Dad, sister Mackenzie (28) and brother Matt (25). She also has two adorable little doggies named Leo and Milo. As a kid, Alexa enjoyed figure skating and cheer, as well as putting on concerts in the living room. Into high school, she was more involved in diving and boardercross. </p>
